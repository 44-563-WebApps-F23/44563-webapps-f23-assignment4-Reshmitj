    <h1>Reshmi acts in a play</h1>
    <h2>An Enemy of the People by Henrik Ibsen</h2>
    <p>
        Dr. Stockmann (calling through the open sitting-room door). Katherine,
        I have found another one.</p>
    <p>
        Mrs. Stockmann (from the sitting-room). Oh, you will find a lot more
        yet, I expect.</p>
    <p>
        Dr. Stockmann (adding the stone to a heap of others on the table). I
        shall treasure these stones as relics. Ejlif and Morten shall look at
        them every day, and when they are grown up they shall inherit them as
        heirlooms. (Rakes about under a bookcase.) Hasn't—what the deuce is
        her name?—the girl, you know—hasn't she been to fetch the glazier yet?</p>
    <p>
        Mrs. Stockmann (coming in). Yes, but he said he didn't know if he would
        be able to come today.</p>
    <p>
        Dr. Stockmann. You will see he won't dare to come.</p>
    <p>
        Mrs. Stockmann. Well, that is just what Randine thought—that he didn't
        dare to, on account of the neighbours. (Calls into the sitting-room.)
        What is it you want, Randine? Give it to me. (Goes in, and comes out
        again directly.) Here is a letter for you, Thomas.</p>
    <p>
        Dr. Stockmann. Let me see it. (Opens and reads it.) Ah!—of course.
