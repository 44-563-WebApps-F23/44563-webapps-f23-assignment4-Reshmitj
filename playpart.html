        Katherine, I have found another one.
    </p>

    <h6 class="name mrs-Stockmann">Mrs. Stockmann.</h6>
    <p class="speech">
        <span class="direction">[from the sitting-room.]</span><br> Oh, you will find a lot more
        yet, I expect.
    </p>

    <h6 class="name dr-Stockmann">Dr. Stockmann.</h6>
    <p class="speech">
        <span class="direction">[adding the stone to a heap of others on the table.]</span><br>
        I shall treasure these stones as relics. Ejlif and Morten shall look at
        them every day, and when they are grown up they shall inherit them as
        heirlooms.<br>
        <span class="direction">[Rakes about under a bookcase.] </span><br> Hasn't—what the deuce is
        her name?—the girl, you know—hasn't she been to fetch the glazier yet?

        be able to come today.

    <h6 class="name dr-Stockmann">Dr. Stockmann.</h6>
    <p class="speech">You will see he won't dare to come.</p>

    <h6 class="name mrs-Stockmann">Mrs. Stockmann.</h6>
    <p class="speech">Well, that is just what Randine thought—that he didn't
        dare to, on account of the neighbours.<br>
        <span class="direction">[Calls into the sitting-room.] </span><br>
        What is it you want, Randine? Give it to me.<br>
        <span class="direction">[Goes in, and comes out
            again directly.]</span><br> Here is a letter for you, Thomas.
    </p>

    <h6 class="name dr-Stockmann">Dr. Stockmann.</h6>
    <p class="speech">Let me see it. <br>
        <span class="direction">[Opens and reads it.] </span><br>Ah!—of course.
